# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
#### R. S. Sutton and A. G. Barto

This repository contains a python implementation of the concepts described in the book _Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction_, by Sutton and Barto.

The repository is still WIP. I will try to move linearly ahead with the book, you can check below for a roadmap of the immadiate actions.

Please, feel free to raise issues to ask questions or flag flaws and mistakes in the implementation.  
Should you find this useful for you, I would be grateful if you'd _star_:star: it :)
